NAME
----
userchown - allow a configurable user to copy files as another user

SYNOPSIS
--------

*userchown* -u 'user' 'INPUT(s)' 'OUTPUT'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A setuid-root binary that allows a configurable user to
copy files as another user (restricted to a configurable group) to a
configurable set of destinations.

Exit codes (documented below) are unique for a number of possible error
conditions

LIMITATIONS
-----------

Copies are done as the user specified, so this user must have read-access to
the input and write-access the output locations.

The locations are carefully checked such that if a symlink in the path below
the configured one escapes to another path that isn't configured, then the
path is rejected.

Allowed-output locations are also expanded, however in the situation where one
valid output path expands via a symlink to another allowed-location, this
second allowed-location, if not listed directly, but rather is another symlink
to a valid location that *is* listed, won't be allowed. This is done
to avoid a case where we'd have to expand all allowed-paths, which we don't
want to do since it would force multiple mounts.
