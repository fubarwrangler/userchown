NAME
----
phnxchown - allow anatrain to copy files as other PHENIX users

SYNOPSIS
--------

*phnxchown* -u 'user' 'INPUT' 'OUTPUT'

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A setuid-root binary that allows a configurable user (currently anatrain) to
copy files as another user (restricted to a configurable group--currently
rhphenix) to a configurable set of destinations.

Exit codes (documented below) are unique for a number of possible error
conditions

LIMITATIONS
-----------

Copies are done as the user, so read-access to the input and write-access to
the output locations are required.

The locations are carefully checked such that if a symlink in the path below
the configured one escapes to another path that isn't configured, then the
path is rejected.

Allowed-output locations are also expanded, however in the situation where an
output path expands via a symlink to another allowed-location, this second
allowed-location, if not listed directly but references a valid location
via another symlink that is listed, won't be allowed. This is done to avoid
a corner case where we'd expand all allowed-paths, which we don't want since
it would force multiple mounts.
